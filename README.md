# prepinsta-codes-100

### Overview
This repository contains solutions to the PrepInsta 100 coding questions aimed at improving logic building and problem-solving skills. The questions cover a variety of topics ranging from basic algorithms to advanced.

### Objective

The primary goal of this project is to practice and enhance my algorithmic thinking and problem-solving skills through structured coding challenges. By solving these problems, I aim to:

- Sharpen my coding skills in languages like JavaScript.
- Develop optimized and efficient solutions to common coding problems.
- Prepare for technical interviews and coding assessments.

### Progress
Currently, I am working through the 100 problem set. As I progress, I will update this repository with my solutions and explanations. Each problem is designed to test different logical and computational skills

### How to Use
Each file contains a specific solution to one of the 100 PrepInsta problems.
Feel free to review, run, or improve upon the provided code solutions.
Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
