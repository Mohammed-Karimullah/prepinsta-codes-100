/*

Given an integer as an input, the objective is to find the Fibonacci series until the number input as the Nth term. 
Therefore, we write a program to Find the Fibonacci Series up to Nth Term

What is Fibonacci Series
Itâ€™s a unique sequence where the next number is the sum of previous two numbers.

Where the first two terms are always 0 and 1
